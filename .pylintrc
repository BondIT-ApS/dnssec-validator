    # Keep these enabled for better code quality:
    # C0413 import-outside-toplevel - should be avoided
    # R0912 too-many-branches - indicates function complexity
    # R0917 too-many-positional-arguments - encourages better API design
    # Security-related warnings are ALL ENABLED for DNSSEC validator

max-locals=15     # Reduce from 20 to encourage better function design
