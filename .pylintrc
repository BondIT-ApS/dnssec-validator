    C0301,  # line-too-long (handled by black formatter)
    C0302,  # too-many-lines (acceptable for main Flask app)
    C0103,  # invalid-name (common patterns like 'id', 'db', 'logger')
    C0411,  # wrong-import-order (handled by import sorting tools)
    C0415,  # import-outside-toplevel (lazy imports for performance)
    E0401,  # import-error (dependencies not installed in linting environment)

    R0913,  # too-many-arguments (API endpoints, database functions)
    R0914,  # too-many-locals (complex Flask routes)
    R0915,  # too-many-statements (initialization functions)

    # Keep these enabled for better code quality:
    # C0413 import-outside-toplevel - should be avoided
    # R0917 too-many-positional-arguments - encourages better API design
    # Security-related warnings are ALL ENABLED for DNSSEC validator

max-locals=15     # Reduce from 20 to encourage better function design
max-statements=50 # Explicit limit for function length
max-branches=12   # Explicit limit for complexity
